Description: tools to manage multiple virtualenvs written in pure python,
 Python Env Wrapper is a set of tools to manage multiple virtual environments. The tools can create, delete and copy your environments, using a single command to switch to them wherever you are, while keeping them in a single (configurable) location.

 The advantage is that pew doesn't hook into a shell, but is only a set of commands that is thus completely shell-agnostic:
 .
 It works on bash, zsh, fish, powershell, etc.
